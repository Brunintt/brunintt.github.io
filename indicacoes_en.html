				<h2><strong>The gaslight effect: how to identify and survive to veiled manipulation that others uso to control your life.</strong></h2>
				<p>Your husband pushes the boundaries by flirting with other women at parties. When you face him, he asks you not to be so insecure and in control. After a long discussion, you apologized for criticizing him. Your mother despises your clothes, your work, your friends and your girlfriends. Instead of defending yourself, as your friends encourage you, you tell them that their mother is usually right and that a mature person should be able to handle criticism. If you think something like this isn't going to happen to you, think twice. Refueling is a form of insidious emotional manipulation and abuse that is harder to recognize and harder to get rid of.</p>

				<h2><strong>SOS Handlers</strong></h2>
				<p>That person has the "gift" of changing everything, from one mothe next! My mood, my mood, my plans, and even what I think of myself! In the presence of that person I feel tired, irritated, stressed and with an inexplicable urge to run away. I feel immense pressure, a kind of annoyance, because it forces me to do what I don't want, and what I want I don't do. Sometimes it makes me feel guilty, with a huge guilt that I can't "digest".After all, what's going on with me?" The answer is simple: you probably have a manipulator in your life. A person who at work, in a love, family or friendship relationship does not let him be who he is, overpowers him, puts his self-esteem at stake and drains his energy and pleasure in living. </p>

				<h2><strong>Machiavellian Minds - The Psychology of Manipulation </strong></h2>
				<p>Liars, scammers and impostors are around the whole world. A lot of them can be totally described by the therm Machiavellian. These people do not respect moral principles, deceive their peers and take advantage of the vulnerability and innocence of others. They use others by using them to achieve their goals, and their victims are not even aware that they are being used. Their minds are sharp, rational and superb, and they are not disturbed by emotions. Sometimes we can't help but be attracted to their talent even though we know they abuse it. Machiavellian Minds is the first comprehensive psychology book on Machiavellianism since the pioneering work of Christi and Geis in 1970. It summarizes the most important research findings in recent decades. Liars, scammers and imposters are all over the world. Many of them can be fully described in the term Machiavelli.</p>

				<h2><strong>Manipulated Minds - Your brain might be tricking you!</strong></h2>
				<p>Why do we buy products advertised by celebrities? Why does time seem to pass faster as we get older? See how the brain can change your perception of things and learn to use Perceptual Intelligence to your advantage! By exploring the brain's abilities to sense and make sense of the world, Dr. Brian Boxer Wachler learns how our perceptions can be real or fanciful - and teaches us to distinguish them. After all, this differentiation is an essential skill for us to improve our Perceptual Intelligence (PI), which can be understood as the way of interpreting and occasionally manipulating experiences to distinguish fantasy from reality. This aptitude depends heavily on our senses and instincts, but is often influenced and distorted by both emotions and memories.</p>

				<h2><strong>Manipulation, Domination and Control</strong></h2>
				<p>One of the biggest obstacles to fulfilling God's will in your church is the manipulative, dominating, and controlling relationships that exist among some Christians. Sometimes leaders dominate and control their congregations instead of guiding them with sensitive ears to the voice of the Holy Ghost. Others, energetic members, manipulate their leaders through a kind of spiritual blackmail. There are many people who try to manipulate their Christian brothers into loving them, paying attention to them, and spending time with them.</p>

				<h2><strong>Public Manipulation</strong></h2>
				<p>Written by two authority figures, the book describes the media role on opinion formation in large scale. This work shows that media is not an independent tool dedicated to truth and justice. The mass media serve the interests of those who control and finance them. To prove this point, several cases over the past two decades have been brought forward, including media reports on the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the subsequent 1994 financial crisis in Mexico, and the handling of protests at the WTO in 00, the world bank and the international monetary fund, as well as the media conspired with abuse the chemical industry.</p>
