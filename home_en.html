				<p id="subtitleartigo">Do you find yourself easy to trick or manipulate? Your answer will probably be: No. Even more so nowadays, where access to information is much easier than other times, right? Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that's not quite the reality. Amazingly, even with easy access to information and countless possibilities to form a “well-grounded” opinion, many of us are manipulated and don't notice. Whether through the media or any other means that can make you think differently. Below, see 10 forms of mini-pulling that are present in our daily lives.

				<p>Act or effect of manipulate.<br>
                Improper or illegitimate influence, control or action in the course of a process.<br>
				The opinions that you protect so much are really yours? It is not new that the media and those who have a high power of influence have the power to transmit information in a very biased way to the population. French author Sylvain Timsit, inspired by the ideas of scientist and philosopher Noam Chomsky, synthesized the ten most used strategies to manipulate people in a massive way. And, taking this to a mass scale, it is very dangerous, especially in times of political and economic crisis that we are going through here in Brazil. To get an idea of ​​what this means, it's as if someone who wants to convince you of something starts to continuously feed you information to the point where you believe it without questioning anything.</p>
				<hr><br>

				<p>Now that you know what manipulation is, let's show you ten manipulation strategies that are most used</p>
				<br>

				<p><strong>1. The Strategy of Distraction</strong><br>

				The primary element of social control is the strategy of distraction, which consists of diverting the public's attention from important problems and changes decided by political and economic elites, through the technique of the deluge, or flood of continual distractions and insignificant information. The distraction strategy is equally indispensable to prevent the public from becoming interested in essential knowledge in the areas of science, economics, psychology, neurobiology and cybernetics.<br><br>

				<strong>2. Create problems and then offer solutions</strong><br>

				This method is also called “problem-reaction-solution“. A problem is created, a “situation” foreseen to cause a certain reaction in the public, so that it is the master of the measures that one wishes to accept. For example: Allowing urban violence to develop or intensify, or organizing bloody attacks so that the public is the mastermind of security laws and policies unfavorable to freedom.<br><br>

				<strong>3. The strategy of gradualness</strong><br>
				To get an unacceptable measure to be accepted, it is enough to apply it gradually, by dropper, for consecutive years. This is how radically new socioeconomic conditions, neoliberalism for example, were imposed during the 1980s and 1990s. Strategy also used by Hitler and several communist leaders. And commonly used by the major media.<br><br>
				<strong>4. To defer </strong><br>

				This strategy consists of making citizens think that a measure is being taken that is temporarily harmful, but which in the future can bring great benefits to society as a whole and, of course, to individuals. 

                The goal is for people to get used to the measure and not reject it, thinking about the supposed good that it will bring tomorrow. The time has come, the effect of “normalization” has already worked and people do not protest because the promised benefits do not arrive. 
                <br><br>

				<strong>5. Childen the audience </strong><br>

				Many of the messages on television, especially advertising, tend to speak to the public as if they were children. They use gestures, words and attitudes that are reconciled and imbued with a certain aura of ingenuity. The objective is to overcome people's resistance. It is one of the mass manipulation strategies that seeks to neutralize people's critical thinking. Politicians also employ these tactics, sometimes portraying themselves as father figures.<br><br>

				<strong>6. Use the emotional aspect much more than reflexion.</strong><br>
				Making use of the emotional aspect is a classic technique to cause a a short circuit in rational analysis, and finally in the critical sense of requirements.<br><br>

				<strong>7. Keeping the public in ignorance and mediocrity.</strong><br>
				Making the public unable to understand the technologies and methods used for their control and their enslavement. 

                he quality of education given to the lower social classes must be as poor and mediocre as possible, so that the gap of ignorance that hovers between the lower classes and the upper social classes is and remains impossible to be reversed by these lower classes. Make the public unable to understand the technologies and methods used for their control and their enslavement. 
                <br><br>

				<strong>8. Promote complacent publics.  </strong><br>

				Most of the fashions and trends are not created spontaneously. They are often induced and promoted from a center of power that exerts its influence to create massive waves of likes, interests, or opinions. <br><br>

				<strong>9. Reinforcement of self-blame</strong><br>

				Another mass manipulation strategy is to make people believe that they, and they alone, are to blame for their problems. Anything negative that happens to them is entirely up to them. In this way, they are led to believe that the environment around them is perfect and that, if a failure occurs, this is the individual's responsibility. <br><br>

				<strong>10. Knowing individuals better than they know themselves.</strong><br>
				Over the past 50 years, accelerated advances in science have created a growing gap between the knowledge of the public and that owned and used by the ruling elites. Thanks to biology, neurobiology and applied psychology, the “system” has enjoyed advanced knowledge about the human psyche, both in its physical and psychological form.</p>
